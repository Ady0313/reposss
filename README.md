Makoto Shinkai's anime movies are absolute magic. The depth of expression, character development, storytelling and animation are what make Makoto's movies tick. The Japanese animator, filmmaker and manga artist has given audiences gems like Garden of Words, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and his last feat Weathering With You. However, Shinkai's most prominent and commercially successful work will always remain Your Name, a true work of art and intelligence.

Things Related To The Trailer :
</u></h1>
<p class="gta">
In the trailer, Suzume comes across a mysterious man who is somehow related to these magical doors. It's also revealed that someone with a key unlocks one of these doors, and destruction overtakes everything around them. There's an uncanny resemblance between Suzume and Makoto Shinkai's previous female protagonists, which may come off as nostalgic to viewers.

But will Suzume no Tojimari's story hold love at its core as it did in Your Name and Weathering With You? <br/>
Will the famous director live up to his reputation and give the audience a simple life lesson through complicated storytelling and mind-blowing visuals? Fans will just have to remain patient until Suzume no Tojimari hits screens in the West.
